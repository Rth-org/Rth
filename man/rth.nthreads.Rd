\title{Determining the Number of Threads a Routine Uses}
\usage{
rth.nthreads()
}
\description{
Note, this only applies for OpenMP and Intel Thread Building Blocks
backends.
}
\details{
\code{rth.nthreads()} will determine the maximum number of threads to use by
checking against the environment variable \code{RTH_NUM_THREADS} (and in the
case of OpenMP, \code{OMP_NUM_THREADS}), and failing that, the default for
the given backend.  For OpenMP this means that the number of cores
(physical+logical) will be returned.  For Intel Thread Building Blocks, the
default is the value \code{-1}.

For any function taking \code{nthreads=} as an argument, the priority is
(highest to lowest): \tabular{ll}{ nthreads argument in the R-level Rth
function \cr RTH_NUM_THREADS environment variable \cr OMP_NUM_THREADS
environment variable (for OpenMP backends) \cr Number of cores }
}
